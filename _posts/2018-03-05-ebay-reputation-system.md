At that time, as we understand from the paper eBay had the following reputation system.
- Buyers and sellers both had reputation
- Positive, Neutral and Negative Feedback in textual form +1,0,-1, respectively.


The results from a 1999 data set show that
- Half of the time a feedback was provided
- Feedbacks were mostly positive
- Reputation profiles were indicators of future performance.
- Better sellers did not enjoy better prices.
- Buyer/Seller feedback was corelated, there was retaliation
