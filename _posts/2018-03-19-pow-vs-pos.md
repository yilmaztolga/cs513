Consensus algorithms play a major role in blockchain systems. They are used to verify and validate transactions as they occur. Some of the algorithms such as Proof of Work are one of
the earlier ones. It is used by Bitcoin and Ethereum. However due to sustainability problems in terms of electricty new protocols have been proposed such as Proof of Stake. Here, we
talk about what they are and their differences.

### Proof of Work (PoW)
Every miner tries to solve a mathematical problem and after finding the answer it receives an award. This part is called the validation part and it is a lot easier than the first part.

#### Disadvantages
1. Requires a lot of hardware resources
2. Requires a lot of electricity
3. It gets harder to mine as more blocks are mined over time

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
Instead of crunching numbers to find hashes, a node is selected to generate a new block with a probability proportional to the number of coins it has i.e., the number of coins determines the power. 
Also there are no block rewards for this one with miners taking the transaction fees.

#### Disadvantages
1. Unlike PoW you need to have some amount of coins before you want to mine.

### Concerns
In order to attack a PoW network, one would really need to put a lot of effort into it, leading to stealing less money than was used. However attacks on PoS network could be cheaper. 

### Conclusion
Although the PoW seems to be more reliable, it requires a lot of energy to be sustanined in the future. New protocols are emerging to solve that problem such as PoS.
