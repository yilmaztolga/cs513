[Blockchain Reputation — Promoting Good Actors In A Free Society](https://press.swarm.city/blockchain-reputation-promoting-good-actors-in-a-free-society-8f6117069cde)

In this article the author starts by stating what reputation is and how it is earned via circles of trust and gives examples about organizations in which reputation matters.
He then talks about the practical and philosophical costs of involving third part elements in your reputation paradigm. Then he points that these costs can be avoided with blockchain.


#### What is reputation?
Reputation is the net of ones interactions with others in a specific context. "Context" is important since one can have more reputation among children than he has among elderly. 

#### Circles of Trust
In our society,trust is established through trust circles where your spouse and children are in the middle  and strangers who don't share your culture are in the outermost ring.

#### Reputation Organizations
With the help of technology people forms organizations such as credit reporting agencies, escrow services etc. where reputation matters. 
Third party companies where formed to minimize the risk of interacting with complete strangers.  But there are costs. See the following.


#### The practical costs of third party intermediaries
- System costs: Running protocols in your systems to increase good reputation. 
- Personal security costs.


#### The philosophical costs of third party intermediaries
- Censorship
- Laws
- Voluntary interactions will be prevented.

#### The answer is blockchain
People in [Swarm City](https://swarm.city/) can form communities and interact with one another in a decentralized manner. Promotes voluntary interactions. 


#### Reputation on the blockchain
The reputation of a user is increased after successful operations. People can see other people's reputation and it shows in which marketplace it was earned. 

### Our Critique:
- System costs, Personal security, laws still apply to this.
