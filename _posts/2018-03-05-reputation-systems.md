---
This highly cited article, published in 2000, starts by stating that along with the convenience of the Internet, it is also risky. 
The authors state that with Internet there needs to be established reputation systems which derive the reputation of participants
from their past transactions.
 
Examples from ebay and bizrate.com are given as sites that utilize reputation systems.

According to the authors, reputation systems require three properties:

- Entities should have enough lifespan to create meaningful expectation about future interactions.
- Capturing current feedback distribution
- Feedback mechanism

Problems with reputation systems
1. Elicitation of feedback 
  - People may not bother to provide feedback
  - Getting negative feedback is harder
  - Honesty 

2. Distribution of feedback
  - Multiple profiles lead to ineffectiveness of reputation systems.
  - Lack of portability.

3. Aggregating and displaying feedback
  - What to show to people
