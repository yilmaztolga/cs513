Here we summarize the following article:

Reputation systems play important role in blockchain systems where bad actors wait in the shadows trying to exploit 
the possible vulnerabilities of people and systems.

Following attacks are possible:
- Collision: (Shilling) where nodes submit fake feedback try to improve each others rating. 
- Reputation Hashing: Creating good reputation and later using in for bad purpose.
- Strategic Deception: Incorporating the reputation from other systems into a new system for the purpose of gaining initial trust faster.
- Faking Identity: Faking or stealing identities

A reputation protocol should support the following:
- Align agent incentives across the network (be prepared for multiple incentives)
- Always incorporate of stake disincentives (malicious activity should have a cost)
- Develop a strong, statistics based reputation engine 
- Develop a scalable, decentralized reputation score propagation method 

Some examples of reputation systems
