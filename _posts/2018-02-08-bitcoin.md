Bitcoin may have started a new era in the ways we define economy and digital world. While we enjoyed shopping online, we did that with credit cards that are built upon our regular currencies such as Dollar and Euro. 
Visa is such a system that offers credit in dollars for instance, to replace regular paper money. 

Paypal was another payment method where you deposited your dollars and transferred money between paypal accounts.

Bitcoin is a cryptographic method that tries to bring a transaction system that is distributed and kept collectively. When you transfer X amount of Bitcoin from one wallet to another, it gets validated across all the nodes and it becomes immutable where one cannot change the amount of money.
